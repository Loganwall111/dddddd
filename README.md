# Enter the Sift — Fabric mod project

The requested Minecraft mod is in **[`fabric-mod/`](fabric-mod/README.md)**. It targets **Minecraft Java 26.3 / Fabric / JDK 25** and includes source, original animated textures, dimension/worldgen data, gameplay functions, an optional Iris shader pack, tests and a GitHub Actions build workflow.

**Status: experimental, uncompiled source alpha.** Offline integrity checks and 20 data tests pass; Minecraft compilation and playtesting are blocked in this workspace by unavailable Java/dependency downloads. No installable JAR is being claimed. Read the [mod guide](fabric-mod/README.md) and [verification record](fabric-mod/docs/BUILD_STATUS.md) before building or testing.

The **0.2 visual pass** follows the newly supplied screenshots: [comparison and remaining gaps](fabric-mod/docs/VISUAL_STATUS.md).

The existing browser project below is preserved; `npm run dev` starts Lumital, not Minecraft.

# Lumital — The Living Reality Engine

A cinematic React + Three.js prototype for a cross-scale open world. Choose a procedural genome, seed a persistent reality, and explore from planetary terrain down through plant cells, digestive acid, sewer tides, and molecular space.

## Cross-scale expeditions

The Living Atlas adds five authored entry routes on top of the seeded world, and the in-game Time panel adds ten traversable life stages from the Hadean Eon through future alien worlds:

- **Leafskin Canopy** — walk a leaf vein, follow a caterpillar and descend into plant cells.
- **Digestive Passage** — be eaten, travel from enamel through saliva, and survive a stomach acid tide.
- **Tidal Underways** — enter storm drains, sewer systems and the open tide.
- **Colossus Range** — traverse the hide and tremors of a giant bull on the route to mountain villages.
- **Planetary Frontier** — explore 75+ biomes, emergent villages, signal castles and floating terrain.

All routes retain a deterministic seed and persistent discoveries. Gathered matter can be consumed, crafted into shelters and tools, or invested into communal signal structures. The world scale navigator exposes 66 generated realms, with procedural city, district and ecosystem systems ready to diverge after first contact.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For the cinematic presentation, choose **Lumital Cinematic** in Settings. The app opens in third-person by default, with the named organism visible in the world. It supports keyboard and mouse exploration with `WASD`, `Q`, `G`, `E`, `T` (camera), `M` (atlas), `N` (craft), `Z/X` (scale), and `I` (inventory).
